# Kisoo's Running Application 
This is a personal project that was carried out in Android programming, which was a lecture for the second semester of 2021.
# What is this project?
This project is a running application that was created based on the existing application called Nike Run. 
In the past, Nike Run had the disadvantage that running and walking were not separate. 
Therefore, the running application allows you to record running and walking separately. 
Also, in the case of the challenge, the Nkm challenge exists, but there is no information about how many runs you have in N days. 
So, this running application is going to offer both.
# Features of this application
* Record Measurement (Walking/Running) -> Complete!
* Search Top 8 of Walking or Running -> Complete!

* Search whole History of Walking or Running -> Complete!
* Running Challenge yourself -> Ongoing!
